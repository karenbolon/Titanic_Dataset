# Titanic_Kaggle_Submission
Predict survival rates of passengers
# [Kaggle Profile](https://www.kaggle.com/karenbolon)

**Business use:**  
A prediction model can help companies target specific clientele to help with cost savings. For example, pretend you are a Sporting Goods company and you are initiating a new marketing campaign to acquire new customers.  You would want to target specific sporty people to ensure a better conversion rate of new customers.  Your money would be better spent targeting people with similar likes than randomly selecting people.

# [Titanic Dataset: Supervised Machine Learning (Predicting Survival Rates)](https://github.com/kbolon1/Titanic_Dataset)

I was able to rank in the top 6% of the Kaggle Titanic Competition (872 out of 14,257 submissions)

* Used python, pandas, seaborn, NymPy, matplotlib, sklearn
* Collected data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
* Implemented and compared a variety of Machine Learning classifiers with scikit-learn (logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest) to predict survival of passengers on the Titanic

* Project consisted of all phases of Machine Learning work-flow: 
	- train-test-splitting of data, 
	- data exploration, 
	- feature engineering, 
	- optimization of hyperparameters, 
	- evaluation of models with cross-validation.
